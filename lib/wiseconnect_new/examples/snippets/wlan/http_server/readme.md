## Purpose/Scope

This application demonstrates how to configure the SiWx91x device as an HTTP server. In this application, the SiWx91x is configured as a Wi-Fi station and connects to an access point and starts an HTTP Server.

## Prerequisites/Setup Requirements

### Hardware Requirements

- Windows PC
- SoC Mode:
  - Silicon Labs [BRD4388A](https://www.silabs.com/)
- NCP Mode:
  - Standalone

## Application Build Environment

The application can be configured to suit your requirements and development environment. Read through the following sections and make any changes needed.

- The application uses the default configurations as provided in the **default_wifi_client_profile** in ``sl_net_default_values.h`` and you can choose to configure these parameters as needed.
- In the Project Explorer pane, expand the **config** folder and open the **sl_net_default_values.h** file. Configure the following parameters to enable your Silicon Labs Wi-Fi device to connect to your Wi-Fi network.

  - STA instance related parameters

    - DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_PROFILE_SSID refers to the name with which the Wi-Fi network shall be advertised and Si91X module is connected to it.

      ```c
      #define DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_PROFILE_SSID               "YOUR_AP_SSID"      
      ```

    - DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_CREDENTIAL refers to the secret key if the access point is configured in WPA-PSK/WPA2-PSK security modes.

      ```c
      #define DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_CREDENTIAL                 "YOUR_AP_PASSPHRASE" 
      ```

    - DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_SECURITY_TYPE refers to the security type if the access point is configured in WPA/WPA2 or mixed security modes.

      ```c
      #define DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_SECURITY_TYPE              SL_WIFI_WPA2 
      ```

  - Configure the following parameters in ``app.c`` to test HTTP Server app as per requirements.

  - HTTP Server Port and IP Settings

    ```c
    #define HTTP_SERVER_PORT           80                 // Http server port
    ```
**Note:** The `sli_si91x_accept_async` function in sl_http_server_start is not thread-safe.

> **Note**: For recommended settings, please refer the [recommendations guide](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-prog-recommended-settings/).

NOTE:
> Procedure to run the example:
> 1. The application initializes the server with request handlers for the "/test" and "/data" URIs.
>
> 2. The server is started.
>
> 3. Open the browser and navigate to the IP Address of SiWx91x module with uri as /test.
>
> 4. For example, you can access the module at `192.168.0.160/test`, where `192.168.0.160` is the IP address of the SiWx91x module.
>
> 5. After serving the request the HTTP Server is stopped and deinitizalized.
